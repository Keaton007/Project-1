## About

    For Project 1, we decided to go with an interactive story book library website. Our MVP is to have one page of a book done, with the main goal of a full book. Our ongoing vision would be to continue adding books to the library. We wrote out a user-flow document and a quick wireframe draft, which have been uploaded.
